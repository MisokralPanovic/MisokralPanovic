# Michal Varga, PhD

**`Molecular biologist that is transitioning into the world of data!`**

I am a recent PhD graduate from the University of Cambridge, where I specialised in molecular pathology and virology. My doctoral research involved extensive data analysis and microscopy, focusing on elucidating the role of antiviral proteins during viral infections. With a strong foundation in project management, data analysis, and scientific research, I am now eager to transition into the fields of data science, analytics and consultancy.

During my PhD, I developed proficiency in Python and R, and completed advanced courses in machine learning, core statistics, and data science. My experience in designing, executing, and analysing complex experiments has equipped me with robust analytical and critical thinking skills. I am passionate about leveraging data to drive insights and inform decision-making processes.

I am enthusiastic about exploring new challenges and applying my scientific expertise to solve real-world problems in a dynamic and multidisciplinary environment. I am particularly interested in opportunities within data science, analytics, and consultancy, where I can contribute to innovative projects and continue to grow my skill set.

 <summary><h3>My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I learned everything during my PhD in molecular virology (from Unversity of Cambridge), but I am still figuring things out. Working on my data science and data analytics portfolio now.

From the guy

I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about this programming world - code, unix, linux, theory. And all the while, teaching myself iOS development with a dream to build my own app, but that soon got overshadowed by my desire to excel in Java. A desire that landed me a full-stack software engineering job upon graduation. However, I had another desire I had been pursuing throughout this time - YouTube content creation. I eventually ended up quitting my software engineering job to pursue YouTube full-time, and that has been my focus ever since. But there's something that's always bothered me about my journey - abandoning my dream of building my own app to pursue the safe route, a job. Now I've already taken the leap away from that safety net into this uncomfortable, unexplored world that it being a creator. And it worked out, but again, it became comfortable. It's easier to create a video than go out on a ledge and build my own product. I do have to eat, at the end of the day, but I think it's time. It's time to get uncomfortable again. I have a burning desire to get back on the horse, and fulfill that dream younger me had of building my own app, my own product. And in order to do that, I'll be implmementing a few measures to streamline my YouTube content to focus more time on fulfilling that dream - a dream that I'll be ready to tackle in 2023 due to the measure I'm putting in place now until the end of 2022. Don't wait up, because I'm coming.
